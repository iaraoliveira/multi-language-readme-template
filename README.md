Yeah, this is what you just read: "a readme-template repository". <br/>
In this, i'll keep a padronization of all my project's readmes.

Feel free to copy them and modify for your own purposes 
(just pay attention to line commands and comments as they may vary)


  Here you will find the following templates:

   - [x] [In construction](./construction) - For those repos that doesn't have notthing yet <br/>

   - [x] [All-in-one](./all-in-on) - The readme for monorepos <br/>

   - [ ] [Mobile](./mobile) - A template for mobile apps <br/>

   - [ ] [Server](./server) - For APIs and stuff<br/>

   - [ ] [Web](./server) - To be used in frontend aplicattions <br/>



<br/>

Okay.. But *"why a multi-languaged readme"*?, you may ask.

Well.. if you're still here, let me tell ya a story:



### :thinking: Should I make my READMEs in Portuguese or English?
<br/>

  Even in the beggining of my journey doing READMEs, I was uncomfortable with this question.
  Well.. I live in Brazil and, even though some of us can comunicate in English very easilly, there is a huge percentage of us that can't. <br/>

  Still, when making this question above, i've always got the same answer, almost instantly: 
  
  > *"YOU SHOULD ALWAYS WRITE READMEs IN ENGLISH, SO EVERYONE WILL UNDERSTAND".*
  >
  > -- Comunity

  As you can see, I wasn't convinced.

  So, the only way was to do.. both.

<br/>

### :v: My answer is: Do both
<br/>

  Considering github does not have any functionallity known by me (until this moment) as a "multi language support" or anything like that,
  I decided to use in this repo a known workaround that links another README file with the desired language.

  If you notice, there is a "button" on the left-top of this file, like this:  
  
  [![en-badge](./.github/lg-button-pt.png)](./README.pt.md)

  ```
    # you can do that this way:

    [![en-badge](./.github/lg-button-pt.png)](./README.pt.md)

    # or using an img tag in HTML
    
    <a href="./README.pt.md">
      <img src="./.github/lg-button-pt.png" alt="pt-br" width="180px" ></img>
    </a>
  ```

  I've put this on every README file, which leads you to a "README.\< abreviation-of-choosen-language \>.md" (in this case, brasilian portuguese)

  Simple as that.
